# Instructions

Hey There! Welcome to homework 2 of the Rails Decal. This week we'll have covered routes (more in depth), simple ruby syntax, and basic CRUD statements. The goal of this assignment is to get you more comfortable with Ruby, a great language with its own...unique features. You'll see.

Between each change you should refresh your browser to observe changes.  If that doesn't work try restarting the server.

Per usual, Google is also your best friend (it's probably alot smarter than us).

This is due at the beginning of the next class. So get started soon.

## To start:
To start everything off, clone this repository. Run this command
```
git clone this_url
```
Afterwards, change directory into the folder and run
```
rails server
```
This should start up your server.
